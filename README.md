Creating Interactive Churn Prediction model
Step 1: Importing Libraries:
Import essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and CatBoost for data processing and model training.
Step 2: Data Loading and Editing:
Load dataset using Pandas and perform initial data editing tasks like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Step 3: Stratified Splitting:
Use StratifiedShuffleSplit to ensure balanced distribution of classes in train-test split for reliable model evaluation.
Step 4: Model Training with CatBoost:
Train the predictive model with CatBoost algorithm, emphasizing the importance of revisiting the model training phase.
Step 5: Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, ROC AUC score, and precision.
